# Multiple Measurement Morphometric Mean Package

Taxonomists often take multiple measurements for each morphometric trait of interest when describing specimens and species.
These measurements are then averaged to obtain a representative value for the trait. 
This package provides a straightforward .R function designed to systematically and efficiently compute these averages, streamlining the process for consistent morphometric analysis.
